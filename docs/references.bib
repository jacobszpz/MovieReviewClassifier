  abstract = {The knowledge discovery in database (KDD) is alarmed with development of methods and techniques for making use of data. One of the most important step of the KDD is the data mining. Data mining is the process of pattern discovery and extraction where huge amount of data is involved. Both the data mining and healthcare industry have emerged some of reliable early detection systems and other various healthcare related systems from the clinical and diagnosis data. In regard to this emerge, we have reviewed the various paper involved in this field in terms of method, algorithms and results. This review paper has consolidated the papers reviewed inline to the disciplines, model, tasks and methods. Results and evaluation methods are discussed for selected papers and a summary of the finding is presented to conclude the paper.},
